# Action-On-Radon

This was a project for a hackathon, and me and my teammate created a website that brings awareness to Radon gas. Built in flask and python, the database is in sql, and it uses folium for the maps. It displays where the gas is the most prevalent in Canada going by province. The main functionality of the database is for users to enter in their postal code (their house) and enter in the radon gas level there, which then gets posted on our live map.
