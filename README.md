# Action-On-Radon

This was a project for a hackathon, and me and my teammate created a web-app that brings awareness to Radon gas. This web-app is built with flask and pythom using a MySQL database and folium for the mapping. It displays where the gas is the most prevalent in Canada going by province and areas inside the province. The main functionality of the database is for users to enter in their postal code and enter in the radon gas level there, which then gets posted on our live map. This allows users who live near the area to see Radon concentrations of areas close to them, allowing them to act accordingly.
